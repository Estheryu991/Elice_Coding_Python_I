# Flamingo that gives twice as much.
# Flamingo, a banker at Coderland E Bank, works twice as hard as others. If you leave the money to a flamingo who works twice as hard, it will return exactly twice the amount a year later. Wow!

# Let's write a code that outputs the money you can receive a year later when you enter the amount to leave to flamingo.


# Let's do it like this!
# After declaring the variable money, write the code to receive user input.
# Please convert the input value to an integer.
# Write a formula so that the amount is doubled.
# Print out money.
# Press the run button to check the results.
# Press the Submit button to check the score.
# Tips
# Input() recognizes the input value as a string, so you have to transform it!

# Change your name to an integer. 


# Let's get the input in #variable money.

# money=input()
# Let's convert # money into int type and put it back into money.
money=int(money)

# Let's double the # money and print it out.
money = money*2
print(money)
